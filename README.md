# StartPage
A basic startpage for firefox, it looks fairly plain at the moment but i might update it in the future.
I suggest uploading it to a site then setting that site as your default Home page as its probably the easiest way!
If you dont have a site then just open the index.html and star the page / always have it open and it should work just the same (works on basically any browser)

Enjoy!!!
